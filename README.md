# Microprocessor Trainer
This project is to make a calculator-sized device that's somewhere between a microprocessor trainer in the spirit of the [KIM-1][1] and a [1980's pocket computer][2]. Calculator-sized and allowing for programming.

# Authors
A very Jamie and MaÃ«lys collab.

# Hardware
This is the hardware used on this project.
* Microcontroller compatible with Arduino IDE
* [Quimat IIC/I2C/TWI Serial 2004 20x4 LCD Module][2]
* [RobotDyn 16 button keypad module][3]


# To-Do
* In interpreter, make sure parameter handling handles line ends that occured before invoking call.
