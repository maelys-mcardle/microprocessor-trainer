# Microprocessor Trainer
This project is to make a calculator-sized device that's somewhere between a microprocesser trainer like the [KIM-1][1] and a 1980's pocket computer like the [Sharp PC-1500][2].

This project is a collaboration between [Jamie][3] and [MaÃ«lys][4].

# Hardware
This is the hardware used on this project:
* Microcontroller compatible with Arduino IDE
* [Quimat IIC/I2C/TWI Serial 2004 20x4 LCD Module][5]
* [RobotDyn 16 button keypad module][6]

# Software
[Snowflake][7] is a high-level programming language developed to program the device using its numeric keypad. An [interpreter][8] that can be run on Linux has also been developed to play with the language.
