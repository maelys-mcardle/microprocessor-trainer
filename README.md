# Microprocessor Trainer
This project is to make a calculator-sized device that's somewhere between a [KIM-1][1] and a [1980's pocket computer][2].

This project is a collaboration between Jamie and MaÃ«lys.

# Hardware
This is the hardware used on this project:
* Microcontroller compatible with Arduino IDE
* [Quimat IIC/I2C/TWI Serial 2004 20x4 LCD Module][3]
* [RobotDyn 16 button keypad module][4]

# Software
A high-level programming language called [Snowflake][5] was developed to allow for programming the device using its numeric keypad. An [interpreter][6] has been developed to simulate programming on the device locally.

# To-Do
* In interpreter, make sure parameter handling handles line ends that occured before invoking call.
